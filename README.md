- **Feature Requests**: Suggestions included adding message encryption, read receipts, and typing indicators.
- **Performance**: Recommendations to improve load times and message delivery under high traffic conditions.

### Implemented Improvements
- **Features**: Added typing indicators and improved notification handling.
- **Performance**: Optimized Socket.io events and backend processes to better handle concurrent users.
